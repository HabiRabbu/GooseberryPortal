<h1 align="center">Gooseberry Portal</h1>

A super simple WPF desktop app for managing a list of quick-access pages or tools - built because I wanted something lightweight, fast, and focused for my home server setup.

## âœ¨ Features

- âœ… Add, remove, and edit custom "pages" (Web-views)

## ðŸ§  Why?

I wanted something like this for my own use - nothing overengineered, just a way to launch the tools and pages I use every day without clutter.

Since it only took an afternoon to make, I figured I'd share it in case it's useful to anyone else.

I might come back to this and improve on it somehow - Let me know if you have any suggestions.

## ðŸ§© How to Install Gooseberry Portal

You can download Gooseberry Portal from the [Releases](https://github.com/HabiRabbu/GooseberryPortal/releases) page.


### ðŸ”¸ If the app installs without issues:

You're all set! Just download the `.msix` file and open it to install.


### ðŸ”¸ If Windows blocks the install:

Because the app isn't signed with a trusted certificate (yet), you may need to manually trust it.

#### Steps:

1. Download both files from the [Releases](https://github.com/HabiRabbu/GooseberryPortal/releases) page:
   - `GooseberryPortal_1.0.0.0_x64.msix`
   - `GooseberryPortal_1.0.0.0_x64.cer`

2. **Install the certificate**:
   - Double-click `GooseberryPortal.cer`
   - Choose **Local Machine**
   - Select **Place all certificates in the following store**
   - Choose **Trusted People**
   - Complete the wizard

3. Run `GooseberryPortal.msix` again â€” it should now install without issues.


### ðŸ’¡ Still not working?

You can also enable Developer Mode:

- Go to **Settings > Privacy & Security > For Developers**
- Toggle **Developer Mode** ON

Then try running the `.msix` file again.

Let me know if you run into any issues!
