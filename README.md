<h1 align="center">Gooseberry Portal</h1>

A super simple WPF desktop app for managing a list of quick-access pages or tools - built because I wanted something lightweight, fast, and focused for my home server setup.

## ðŸ§  Why?

I wanted something like this for my own use - nothing overengineered, just a way to launch the tools and pages I use every day without clutter.

Since it only took an afternoon to make, I figured I'd share it in case it's useful to anyone else.

I might come back to this and improve on it somehow - Let me know if you have any suggestions.

## ðŸ“¥ Installation

1. Download the latest `.msix` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/HabiRabbu/GooseberryPortal/releases) page
2. If prompted, install the certificate
3. Double-click the installer

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- This is a first version - very basic by design
- I'm happy to keep it simple, but if you'd like to see it improved, open an issue or suggest a feature
- Could be fun to keep iterating on it ðŸ™‚
