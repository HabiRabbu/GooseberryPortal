<h1 align="center">Gooseberry Portal</h1>

A super simple WPF desktop app for managing a list of quick-access pages or tools - built because I wanted something lightweight, fast, and focused for my home server setup.

## âœ¨ Features

- âœ… Add, remove, and edit custom "pages" (Web-views)
- âœ… Quick-launch interface
- âœ… Persistent storage (your pages are saved)
- âœ… Minimalist UI with dark styling
- âœ… Packaged as a standalone `.msix` installer

## ðŸ§  Why?

I wanted something like this for my own use - nothing overengineered, just a way to launch the tools and pages I use every day without clutter.

Since it only took an afternoon to make, I figured I'd share it in case it's useful to anyone else.

I might come back to this and improve on it somehow - Let me know if you have any suggestions.

# ðŸ§© How to Install

Because this app isn't signed with a trusted certificate yet, Windows might block it. Here's how to install:

1. Download and run `gooseberry-portal.msix`
   - If it fails, proceed to step 2

2. Download `gooseberry-cert.cer` and double-click it

3. In the wizard:
   - Select **Local Machine**
   - Choose **Place all certificates in the following store**
   - Pick **Trusted People**

4. After installing the certificate, run the `.msix` again.

If you're unsure, you can also enable Developer Mode in Windows settings.
